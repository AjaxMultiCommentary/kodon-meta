# _Ajax_ Meta-Commentary

This **meta-commentary** about Sophocles' *Ajax* aims to demonstrate how the [Kōdōn](https://github.com/AjaxMultiCommentary/kodon) Javascript library can be used to publish digital commentaries with minimal technical requirements. 

For the time being, it contains only a few glosses about the [prologue (vv. 1-133)](passages/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0011.tlg003:1-133).
